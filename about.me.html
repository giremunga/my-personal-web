                I undertook my primary school education at a catholic based school known as <strong>Diwopa Catholic Primary School</strong>This school basically built a very important impact in my religious life and background as a catholic.It taught me good christian values as  a young child .I managed to attain  a score of 411 marks in my <strong>KCSE</strong>examination.I was then admitted to a national school of my choice ,MARYHILL GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL.
